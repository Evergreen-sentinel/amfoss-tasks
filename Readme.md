## WHY YOU SHOULD CHOOSE ME?

I may not have prior experience with projects or research, but I am deeply passionate about coding and eager to learn. I bring a strong commitment to tasks assigned to me and a willingness to devote myself fully to the club's goals. Joining amFOSS isn't just about what I can gain; it's about what I can contribute and how I can grow personally and professionally. I see this as an opportunity to immerse myself in new experiences, develop new skills, and become a valuable member of the team.

## WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS?

My plan for the next 6 months are to have a strong base in a coding language such as python, I have only studied java and c++ after coming to Amrita as i was a bio maths student in school. I am also planning to select a particular frame work and try to learn everything about it and have a excellent base in that also. I also plan on enhancing my problem solving skills and invest time in general studies for overall improvement.

## HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?

I'm excited to lend a hand in the club's projects, competitions, and events, striving to play my part in propelling the club to new heights of glory.
