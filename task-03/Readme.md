## Hello World!

I have only studied java, c++ and python so i had to use other sources to find the syntax of the other coding languages like ruby, elixir. Understanding C language for fairly easier as it was somewhat similar to C++. I had used Ai to convert my existing code to get the syntax and i have studied what those lines of codes mean.
